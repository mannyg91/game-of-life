This is a summer project for the TechWise program. It is a multi-featured version of John Conwayâ€™s cellular automaton, that includes a 
MIDI musical mode and isometric-3D representation.

It can be run by launching main.py while the other .py files and the assets folder (unzipped) are in the same directory.
