# game-of-life

This is a summer project for the TechWise program. It is a multi-featured version of John Conwayâ€™s cellular automaton, that includes a 
MIDI musical mode and isometric-3D representation.

It can be run by launching main.py along with having the Assets folder in the same directory. 

As of 8/12/22, it is still a work in progress.
